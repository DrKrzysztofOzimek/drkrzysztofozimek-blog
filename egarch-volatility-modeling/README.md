# ðŸ“Š Modeling Asymmetric Volatility with EGARCH

This folder contains R and Python code supporting the blog post on modeling time-varying volatility using the Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model, which captures both volatility clustering and the leverage effect in financial return series.

## ðŸ’» Code files included:

- `egarch.R` â€“ R script to estimate an EGARCH(1,1) model using the `rugarch` package.
- `egarch.py` â€“ Python script for EGARCH(1,1) estimation using the `arch` package.
- `returns.csv` â€“ Sample return series data for model input and forecasting.

## ðŸ§  Summary

This code enables researchers, analysts, and students to estimate EGARCH models and explore how volatility responds asymmetrically to past shocks. Itâ€™s particularly useful for forecasting volatility in risk management, derivatives pricing, and volatility arbitrage strategies.
